## Disclaimer

The HTML files included in this folder are **Javadoc output generated from original source code owned by this project** using the standard `javadoc` tool provided with the Java Development Kit (JDK), ranging from versions 8 to 21.

These files are included strictly for **testing and development purposes** related to the parsing logic of this project.

- No third-party or official JDK class documentation is included.
- No Oracle or OpenJDK copyrighted documentation was used.
- No styling, scripting, or assets (e.g. `stylesheet.css`, `script.js`) from the default Javadoc output are included.
- All HTML was generated locally using `javadoc` on code written by the author of this project.

If you have questions about usage or licensing, feel free to open an issue.

## TODOs
- Proper unit tests for each scraper. For now the integration test is enough.
- Add package description to fixtures.
